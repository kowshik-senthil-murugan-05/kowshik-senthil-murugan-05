# Hi, I'm Kowshik Senthil Murugan — Backend Engineer (Java | Spring Boot)

## 🔥 About me
I’m a backend software engineer with **2 years** of professional experience in **Java, Spring Boot and MySQL**.  
I build reliable backend systems, write clean code, and design production-ready architectures. 

## 🛠 Tech stack (core)
**Languages:** Java (11/17), SQL  
**Backend:** Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA, REST, JWT  
**Distributed:** Kafka, Redis (cache), RabbitMQ (optional)  
**Databases:** MySQL / PostgreSQL  
**Infra & DevOps:** Docker, Kubernetes  
**Testing:** JUnit, Mockito
**Tools:** Git, GitHub Actions, Postman, IntelliJ

## 🚀 Current focus
- Convert an e-commerce backend into microservices (API Gateway, Order, Inventory, Product, Cart).  
- Implement event-driven flows with Kafka + Saga (order lifecycle).  
- Containerize and run on Kubernetes, add observability.  
- Strengthen DSA & System Design for product-based interviews.

## 📌 Featured projects
(These will be pinned on my profile — click to view)
- **E-Commerce Backend** — Spring Boot monolith → planned microservices. APIs, MySQL, payment workflow. (Repo: `ecommerce-backend`)  
- **Microservices Starter** — Kafka + Redis + Spring Boot microservices demo (Repo: `microservices-starter`)  
- **System Design / LLD** — LLD implementations and diagrams (Parking Lot, Notification System, Library) (Repo: `lld-designs`)

## ✅ What I bring to a product team
- Ownership: I design, implement, test, and deploy end-to-end features.  
- Clarity: I explain architecture decisions, trade-offs, and scaling plans.  
- Resilience: I build for failure — retries, idempotency, circuit breakers, and observability.  
- Continuous improvement: I use tests, CI pipelines and containerization to ensure reliable delivery.
